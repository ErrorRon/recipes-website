            <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
            <p>The perfect savoury scone - Best eaten warm spread liberally with butter!</p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>225g Plain flour</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tsp. Baking powder</li>
                    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>A pinch of pepper</li>
                    <li>A pinch of paprika</li>
                    <li>50g Butter</li>
                    <li>125g Cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>140ml Milk</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                   <li>Prehead oven at 200c. Grease baking tray with margarine.</li>
                   <li>Mix flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large bowl.</li>
                   <li>Grate cheese and butter on a plate. Rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs
                       Add cheese to mixture, <em>(keep a small amount of cheese for the top of the scones.)</em></li>
                    <li>Slowly add the milk until the dough is the right consistency, <em>(Keep a tiny amount of milk for glazing).</em></li>
                    <li>Knead the dough into a ball with your hands, avoid handling the dough too much. Sprinkle flour on surface to avoid
                        sticking and pat dough flat until 2cm thick.</li>
                        <li>Cut out the scones and place onto baking tray. Brush top with milk and add a few strands of cheese to the top of each scone.</li>
                        <li>Place in the centre of oven for 25 minutes. Keep an eye on them and if the outside is browning too fast, cover with foil and
                            return to oven.</li>
                        <li>Place on wire cooling rack for 15 minutes.</li>
                        
                </ol>
